The Borouge ESG Intelligence Platform implements comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive ESG data and ensure secure operations.

## 🚨 Current Security Status

### ✅ **Production Security - SECURE**
- **Runtime Security**: ✅ All production dependencies are secure
- **API Security**: ✅ Rate limiting, CORS, input validation implemented
- **Environment Security**: ✅ All secrets externalized to environment variables
- **Database Security**: ✅ Supabase with RLS policies and secure connections
- **Container Security**: ✅ Non-root users, minimal attack surface

### ⚠️ **Development Dependencies - Known Issues**

**Current Vulnerabilities (Development Only):**
- **nth-check**: High severity - Inefficient regex in CSS parsing (dev only)
- **postcss**: Moderate severity - Line return parsing error (dev only)

**Impact Assessment:**
